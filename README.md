# SignDict.org

Here we will work on SignDict. A sign language dictionary
where everyone can add new signs using their webcam. With
this unique crowdsourcing approach we together can create
the most accurate sign language dictionary there is.

The development started in 1st of march and there is not
that much to see here.
